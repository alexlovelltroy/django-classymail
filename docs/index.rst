Django-ClassyMail
=================

It's easy to send a simple e-mail using Django. But e-mails sometimes gets
really complicated and un-DRY. That's why I created ClassyMail.


Features
--------

* Timezone and language support
* CSS inlining support - allows you to write normal stylesheets instead of
  ``style=""`` attributes for every tag
* Code reuse with mixins (just like class based views)


Installation
------------

ClassyMail is available on PyPI, so just install using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install django-classymail


Contents:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
